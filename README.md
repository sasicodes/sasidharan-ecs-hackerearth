> Frontend Application by Sasidharan

- I have used react to build this application
- Using axios for fetching REST APIs.
- Used react-indexed-db to store all the data in local browser for rapid performance.

# Description
I have created a new react setup using create-react-app and install required dependencies mentioned. Using axios fetched all data from given URL and stored in IndexedDB. Every time user hits refresh, will check for data in IndexedDB and show thw list. Created a table view component to list all the books with checkbox, user can select books and the selected ones were add to left side CART and checkout.

## Deployment
Unzip the attached code and inside the root folder,
```
npm install
```
to install all dependencies.
```
npm start
```
to start the dev server.

Based the given requirements, I have attached the source zip with the test in hackerearth.
