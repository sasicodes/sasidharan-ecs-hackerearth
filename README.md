> Frontend Application by Sasidharan

- I have used react to build this application
- Using Axios for fetching REST APIs.
- Used react-indexed-DB to store all the data in the local browser for rapid performance.

# Description
I have created a new react setup using create-react-app and install the required dependencies mentioned. Using Axios fetched all data from the given URL and stored in IndexedDB. Every time user hits refresh, will check for data in IndexedDB and show the list. Created a table view component to list all the books with checkbox, user can select books and the selected ones were added to left side CART and checkout.

## Deployment
Unzip the attached code and inside the root folder,
```
npm install
```
to install all dependencies.
```
npm start
```
to start the dev server.

Based on the given requirements, I have attached the source zip with the test in HackerEarth.
